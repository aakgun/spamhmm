# SpaMHMM
Sparse Mixture of Hidden Markov Models for Graph Connected Entities

## Description
Source code for the implementation of SpaMHMM, as described in the paper:

Diogo Pernes and Jaime S. Cardoso, *SpaMHMM: Sparse Mixture of Hidden Markov Models for Graph Connected Entities*, under review for the Seventh International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2019).

The experiments described there may be reproduced by running the scripts ```h36m_test.py``` and ```wifi_test.py``` after downloading the
respective datasets (see informations below).
